A weekend hack project to create autonomous rock, paper and scissor pieces who move around a 2D plane.

Using:

- [HTML Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas)
- [requestAnimationFrame Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)
- [Web Workers Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API)
- Vector logic & rudimentary AI

Each piece attempts to move towards it's nearest thing that it can beat (prey) and away from the nearest thing that it beats it (predator). This can create amusing and entertaining visuals. Try it out see who wins.
